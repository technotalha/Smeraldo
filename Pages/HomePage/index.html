<div class="Company">
  <p> Smeraldo is all about promoting chemical-free, cruelty-free, and eco-friendly beauty products. It's our goal to provide to you the best that nature has to offer.</p>
  <p> Chemical-free:
Most lip balms available in the market almost always contain synthetic ingredients such as petrochemicals and manufactured ingredients for coloring and fragrance. Smeraldo's organic lip balms are made from purely natural ingredients - our bases are made from shea butter, beeswax, coconut oil, and vitamin e - to promote the health benefits of the ingredients used.</p>
  <p> Cruelty-free:
Smeraldo is committed to creating not only products that don’t harm animals or are tested on them but also ones that are ideal for people who practice a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle.</p>
  <p> Eco-friendly
Non-organic lip balms often times contain ingredients that can harm the environment, either through how they’re derived or how they’re manufactured. They may also contain synthetic products that are manufactured and may produce byproducts that can damage the environment. Smeraldo's core philosophy aims to promote beauty products that don't damage the environment we live in. Our organic lip balms contain natural ingredients that often have far less impact on nature's elements.</p>
